# BrainyQuest

BrainyQuest is a small, static educational web project with a collection of kid-friendly games and puzzles. Itâ€™s built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript so itâ€™s easy to run locally or host on any static site host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.).

## Features

- Home, login, contact and about pages
- Games and puzzles organized under `games/`:
  - `Alpha/` â€” alphabet-related game
  - `puzzles/` â€” shape, color, jigsaw, memory and math puzzle pages
  - `quiz/` â€” quiz page with `quiz.js`
- Simple timer functionality in `timer.js`
- Main scripts: `script.js`, per-game JS files in game folders

(This `README.md` lives in the `home/` folder alongside the site files.)

## How to run locally

Option A â€” Open in browser:

1. Double-click `index.html` (or open it with your browser). This works for most pages that donâ€™t require a server.

## Development notes

- Files are plain HTML/CSS/JS; no build step required.
- Keep images under `img/` or the per-game `img/` folder.
- For new games, add a folder under `games/`, add an HTML file and any JS/CSS assets, and link from `index.html` or `game.html`.
